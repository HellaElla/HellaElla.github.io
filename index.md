# Welcome!
My name is Ella...

Here is my tiny blog site. Sometimes I write about **Art, Music, and Technology** and really whatever else I am thinking about at the time.

I am a graduate student in New York, working on Media Arts projects, Spatial audio and some mediocre software development projects.
Outside of that I am also a synthesizer enthusiast, currently getting my ~~shit together~~ bearings to participate in a composer residency in Boston. 
I hold a B.M from Berklee College of Music, Boston.

# What I do
Honestly, describing my work gets sort of nebulous at times. 
I label myself as:

An artist

Sound Designer

Composer

While some people might say my work is about the intersection of art & technology, tech really just enables me to produce results.

I work with languages such as [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/) , [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/), (some) Python, and Csound.
